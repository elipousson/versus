## Overview

versus is a package for comparing two data frames. All output is provided as a data frame or list of data frames. By default, comparisons are done using {duckplyr} for speed.

## Installation

You can install the development version of versus like so:

``` r 
devtools::install_github("eutwt/versus")
```

## Example

We will use the two data frames below as an example to demonstrate functionality

```{r}
library(versus)

example_df_a
example_df_b
```

Use `compare()` to see 

* The number of differing values in each column - `compare()$summ`
* Which columns are in only one table - `compare()$unmatched_cols`
* Which rows are in only one table - `compare()$unmatched_rows`
```{r}
comp <- compare(example_df_a, example_df_b, by = car)
comp
```

Use `value_diffs()` to see the specific values that are different.

```{r}
value_diffs(comp, disp)
value_diffs(comp, mpg)
```

Use `all_value_diffs()` to combine all `value_diffs()` output into one table 

* `val_a` and `val_b` are coerced to character
```{r}
all_value_diffs(comp)
```
